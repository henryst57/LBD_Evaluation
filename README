Code for hybrid dataset creation and indirect association measure analysis

Folders and files in each:

datasetCreation
   getSemMedDBData.pl - gets matrices from SemMedDB mysql database
   createWholeDataset.pl - creates all possible hybrid datasets
   getDataStats.pl - gets stats about each hybrid dataset
   
scoreCreation
   computeCosineForVectorFile.pl - computes cosine scores
   getScores.pl - gets scores for all indirect measures (uses UMLS::Association)

evaluation
   generateAllResults.pl - generates results for all indirect association measures
   createPRC.pl - generates a PRC curve
   createPrecisionAtK.pl - generates a precision at K graph
   flipNegs.pl - flips -1 (can't compute indicator) to 99999, should be used if sorting in ascending order
   combinePlots.pl - used to combine PRC plots of different measures into a single file to make plotting easier
